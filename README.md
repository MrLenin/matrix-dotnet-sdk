# Matrix .NET SDK

This project provides a SDK for interfacing with the Matrix Protocol.

It has support for a limited subset of the C2S and AS APIs presently. Support for new endpoints is easy to add,
so please ask if you want a endpoint to be added.

The SDK is built against 'netcoreapp3.1', and will work with .NET core projects.

** This fork is not entirely API compatible with its predecessors! **

## How to Use

## Documentation

Documentation is covered for the Client (and *some* of the API), however no online resources exist yet.

## Reporting Issues

Please report bugs/features through the github issue tracker.

If you have a pressing issue, you can find me on IRC as ibutsu on AfterNET IRC in #evilnet
